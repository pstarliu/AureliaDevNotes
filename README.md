Aurelia Development App Notes following Rob's Course

The download provided from Rod's video no longer avaliable. Initially I was trying to following along the video by typping the code on hand,
thought it might be taking longer, but is doable and will help me learn better by typing code myself. But it turns out that not all the code
are going to be shown in the video.

Now I found a couple of repositories in Github which does has the steps code initially provided by Rod:[From bpringe] (https://github.com/bpringe/aurelia-notes.git).
